## About

I’m a Software Development Engineer in Test with hands-on experience building reliable test systems for modern web applications. I focus on preventing defects early and strengthening release confidence through thoughtful testing and automation.

Testing, for me, is not a phase at the end of development — it’s a continuous responsibility that starts with understanding requirements and ends with confident releases.

## How I Think About Testing

- Automate what is repeatable, critical, and high-risk
- Prefer fewer meaningful tests over many fragile ones
- Treat flaky tests as production bugs
- Focus on user journeys, not just UI elements
- Write bug reports developers respect and act on

---

## Testing Impact

- Reduced regression execution time through better test prioritization
- Improved CI reliability by identifying and fixing flaky tests
- Detected critical defects before production releases
- Helped teams ship faster with higher confidence
